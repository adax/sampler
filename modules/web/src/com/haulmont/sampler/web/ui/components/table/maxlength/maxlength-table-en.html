<p><code>maxTextLength</code> - an optional attribute allowing to limit the number of characters in a cell.</p>

<p>If the difference between the actual and the maximum allowed number of characters does not exceed the 10 character
    threshold, the "extra" characters remain unhidden. In this example, only one cell contains a value that is longer
    than <code>maxTextLength+10</code> and becomes trimmed.</p>
