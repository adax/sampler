<p>In order to divide screen space non-equally, a <code>column</code> element with a <code>flex</code> attribute should
    be defined for each column. If <code>flex</code> is not defined, or is set to 0, the width of the column will be set
    according to its contents given that at least one other column has a non-zero <code>flex</code>.</p>

<p>In this example, the first and the third columns will get the width according to the maximum text length.
    The second and fourth columns will get all remainded space, wherein the fourth will get three times more space
    then the second.</p>

<p>In order for the free space to appear, the entire container width should be set in either pixels or percents.
    Otherwise, column width will be calculated according to content length, and <code>flex</code> attribute will
    have no effect.</p>
