<p>An option dialog is a modal window that includes a message and one or more buttons which represent <a
        href="https://docs.cuba-platform.com/cuba/latest/manual/en/html-single/manual.html#gui_Action" target="_blank">actions</a>
    available to users.</p>

<p>The dialog can be invoked by <code>showOptionDialog()</code> method of the <code>Frame</code>
    interface. This interface is implemented by screen controllers, so these methods can be used directly in the
    controller code.</p>

<p>In addition to parameters described for <code>showMessageDialog()</code>, the method takes an array or a list of
    actions. A button is created for each action. After a button is clicked, the dialog closes and invokes the
    <code>actionPerform()</code> method of the corresponding action.</p>

<p>If you need an action with a standard name and icon, use an anonymous class derived from <code>DialogAction</code>.
    Five types of actions are supported: <code>OK</code>, <code>CANCEL</code>, <code>YES</code>, <code>NO</code>, <code>CLOSE</code>.
    Names of corresponding buttons are extracted from the <a

            target="_blank">m–∞in message pack</a>.</p>
