<p><code>ButtonsPanel</code>&nbsp;is a container that streamlines the use and placement of the components (usually, buttons) for data management in a table.</p>

<p><code>buttonsPanel</code>&nbsp;element can be located either inside a&nbsp;<code>table</code>, or in any other place of a screen.</p>

<p>If the&nbsp;<code>buttonsPanel</code>&nbsp;is located in a&nbsp;<code>table</code>, it is combined with the table&#39;s&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.cuba-platform.com/cuba/latest/manual/en/webhelp/gui_Table.html#gui_attr_table_rowsCount" target="_blank">rowsCount</a>&nbsp;component thus using vertical space more effectively. Additionally, if a lookup screen is opened using&nbsp;<code>IFrame.openLookup()</code>&nbsp;(for example, from the&nbsp;<a href="open?screen=simple-pickerfield">PickerField</a>&nbsp;component) the buttons panel becomes hidden.</p>
