<p>The&nbsp;<code>LookupField</code>&nbsp;component is able to handle user input if there is no suitable option in the list. In this case,&nbsp;<code>setNewOptionAllowed()</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>setNewOptionHandler()</code>&nbsp;are used.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<code>NewOptionHandler</code>&nbsp;handler is invoked if the user enters a value that does not coincide with any option and presses&nbsp;<strong>Enter</strong>. In this case, a new&nbsp;<code>Colour</code>&nbsp;entity instance is created in the handler, its&nbsp;<code>name</code>&nbsp;attribute is set to the value entered by the user, this instance is added to an option data source and selected in the component.</p>
<p>Instead of implementing the&nbsp;<code>LookupField.NewOptionHandler</code>interface for processing user input, the controller method name can be specified in the&nbsp;<code>newOptionHandler</code>XML-attribute. This method should have two parameters, one of&nbsp;<code>LookupField</code>, and the other of&nbsp;<code>String</code>type. They will be set to the component instance and the value entered by the user, accordingly.</p>
