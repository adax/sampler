<p>In the screen controller two component methods can be implemented that will be invoked:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>
        <p>If the number of entered characters is less than the value of&nbsp;<code>minSearchStringLength</code>&nbsp;attribute.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>If the search of characters entered by the user has returned no results.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
