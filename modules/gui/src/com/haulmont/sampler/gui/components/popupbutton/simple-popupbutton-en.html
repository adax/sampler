<p><code>PopupButton</code> is a button with a drop-down list of
    <a href="https://docs.cuba-platform.com/cuba/latest/manual/en/html-single/manual.html#gui_Action" target="_blank">actions</a>.</p>

<p>The PopupButton contain text or icon (or both).</p>

<p>In this example, two buttons have actions defined in XML. The third button has actions programmatically
    added in the controller. These actions automatically obtain their captions from the localized messages pack by keys
    equal to the action identifiers.</p>
