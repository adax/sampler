<p>Text field can be assigned a&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.cuba-platform.com/cuba/latest/manual/en/webhelp/gui_validator.html" target="_blank">validator</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a class implementing&nbsp;<code>Field.Validator</code>&nbsp;interface. The validator limits user input in addition to what is already done by the&nbsp;<code>datatype</code>.</p>
<p>Unlike input check against the data type, validation is performed not when the field looses focus, but after invocation of the field&rsquo;s&nbsp;<code>validate()</code>&nbsp;method. It means that the field (and the linked entity attribute) may temporarily contain a value that does not satisfy validation conditions (a non-positive number in the example above).</p>
